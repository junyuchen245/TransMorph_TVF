# Unsupervised Learning of Diffeomorphic Image Registration via TransMorph

We propose a learning-based framework for unsupervised and end-to-end learning of diffeomorphic image registration. Specifically, the proposed network learns to produce and integrate ***time-dependent velocity fields*** in an LDDMM setting.
